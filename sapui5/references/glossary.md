## Core UI Concepts

**Aggregation**: A special relationship defining parent-child hierarchies in UI elements. The parent end has cardinality 0..1, while children may have 0..1 or 0..*. Used to build complex UI structures.

**Association**: A loose coupling between UI element types independent of tree structure, implemented by storing target element instance IDs. Used for references without ownership.

**Control**: Independent UI elements like Button, Label, TextField, or Table that manage rectangular screen regions and serve as entry points for rendering. Controls are the building blocks of SAPUI5 applications.

**Element**: The basic building block of user interfaces—reusable entities with properties, events, methods, and relations forming tree structures.

**Property**: Named attributes with associated data types, accessible via getters and setters, with well-defined default values. Examples: text, enabled, visible.

**Event**: Named occurrences with parameters; the element's API supports managing event subscriptions. Examples: press, change, selectionChange.

---

## Architecture & Development

**Library**: Top-level structural units bundling controls, types, and making them consumable by applications. Examples: sap.m (mobile), sap.ui.table (tables), sap.f (fiori).

**Model**: Data provider assigned to UI where controls bind to data. Various types available depending on server-side data formats (JSON, OData, XML, Resource).

**View**: Application unit defining control definitions for the user interface layer's appearance. Available types: XML, JSON, JavaScript, HTML.

**Controller**: Active application unit serving as the logical interface between model and view, embodying MVC concepts. Contains event handlers and business logic.

**Component**: Self-contained, reusable unit with manifest.json configuration. Represents a complete application or reusable part.

**Bootstrap**: Process of loading and initializing SAPUI5 runtime in HTML pages via the sap-ui-core.js script tag.

**Fragment**: Reusable UI snippet without its own controller. Can be XML, JSON, JavaScript, or HTML format.

---

## Data & Integration

**Data Binding**: Technique synchronizing two data sources, with changes in one automatically reflected in the other. Supports one-way, two-way, property, aggregation, and element binding.

**Data Type**: First-class entities in the meta model allowing reuse across libraries and system extensibility. Examples: sap.ui.model.type.String, sap.ui.model.type.Date, sap.ui.model.type.Currency.

**OData**: "Standard protocol that defines best practices for building and consuming an interface to backend systems over the web." Based on REST principles.

**OData Model**: Implementation supporting the Open Data Protocol format for structured data communication. Available in v2 and v4 versions.

**Mock Server**: Mocking framework for HTTP/HTTPS simplifying integration testing and decoupling development teams. Simulates OData services.

**Resource Model**: Model for internationalization (i18n) containing translated texts. Uses Java properties file format.

**JSON Model**: Client-side model for JavaScript object data. Suitable for small datasets and configuration data.

**XML Model**: Client-side model for XML data structures.

---

## SAP Fiori Elements

**SAP Fiori Elements**: Predefined template views and controllers enabling developers to create applications based on OData services and annotations "requiring no JavaScript UI coding."

**Annotations**: Metadata accompanying application data, controlling display, position, sort order, measures, dimensions, and navigation enablement in UI controls. Examples: @UI.LineItem, @UI.SelectionFields, @UI.FieldGroup.

**Key Annotations**: Critical annotations defining rendering or behavior. Examples: LineItem, SelectionFields, InsertRestrictions, UpdateRestrictions.

**Manifest**: Main configuration file (manifest.json) where developers define application settings and interface behavior, including filter fields, table properties, and routing.

**Action**: "Business function in the application backend that can be triggered by the user from the UI using an action button." Can be bound or unbound.

**Facet**: Basic building block of object pages—can be header facets, reference facets (rendered as forms/tables/charts), or collection facets (sections holding multiple references).

**Section**: Top-level grouping of object page facets below the header, containing subsections with associated facets.

**Entity**: Business object in OData definitions; associations define relationships enabling navigation. Example: SalesOrder with SalesOrderItems.

**Main Entity**: Entry entity holding information displayed in SAP Fiori templates. Example: SalesOrder in a Manage Sales Order application.

**Navigation Entity**: Associated entities with detailed information (1:n or 1:1 relationships with main objects). Example: SalesOrderItems related to SalesOrder.

**iAppState**: Inner application state storing information required to retrieve app state when URLs reload, including filters and sort orders.

**xAppState**: External application state representing source app context passed during navigation, including filter values and selected row data.

**Determining Action**: Finalizing action at page bottom applying to entire page context (object/subobject pages). Example: Approve, Reject.

**Paginator Buttons**: Toolbar buttons enabling navigation between previous/next object pages displayed in list reports.

**Draft**: Temporary version of a business entity allowing users to save incomplete work. Drafts are stored separately from active data.

**Flexible Column Layout**: Responsive UI pattern showing up to 3 columns (list, detail, detail-detail) based on screen size.

---

## MVC Pattern

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Architectural pattern separating application logic (controller), data (model), and presentation (view).

**Binding Context**: Link between a UI element and data in a model. Determines which data is displayed.

**Binding Path**: String expression pointing to data in a model. Absolute paths start with "/", relative paths don't.

**Formatter**: Function converting model data to display format. Example: formatting date, currency, or status.

**Expression Binding**: Inline data binding with simple expressions. Example: {= ${quantity} > 10 ? 'high' : 'low'}.

**Content Density**: Adaptive design feature allowing controls to adjust for touch-enabled devices (larger - cozy) or mouse-operated devices (compact).

**Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking mode executing tasks in background with callback triggers; "highly recommended for performance reasons and to not freeze the UI."

**Synchronous Processing**: Blocking mode keeping browser thread busy until tasks complete; not recommended for long-running operations.

**Bundling**: Combining multiple files into fewer files to reduce HTTP requests.

**Minification**: Removing whitespace and shortening variable names to reduce file size.

**Preload Files**: Bundled resources loaded at application startup. Generated by UI5 Tooling.

**Component Preload**: Single file containing all component resources for faster loading.

**Clickjacking**: "UI redressing that tricks users into triggering actions by redirecting clicks," often using invisible iFrames. Prevented using frame-options and CSP.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: "Injecting script code into web pages executed in page context," potentially accessing displayed information and session cookies. SAPUI5 provides automatic XSS protection via output encoding.

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Security standard preventing XSS by controlling which resources can be loaded. SAPUI5 supports CSP-compliant development.

**Input Validation**: Checking user input for valid format and content. Use data types and validators.
