# Destination Configuration Templates

## How to Use This Template

- **Purpose**: Configure SAP BTP destinations for SAP Business Application Studio connectivity
- **When to Use**: Connecting to ABAP systems, OData services, or external systems
- **Instructions**: Replace `[bracketed values]` with your specific configuration

---

## Template 1: ABAP On-Premise System

Use for connecting to SAP S/4HANA, ECC, or other on-premise ABAP systems.

```properties
# Basic Configuration
Name = [DESTINATION_NAME]
Type = HTTP
URL = [https://[virtual-host]:[port]](https://[virtual-host]:[port])
ProxyType = OnPremise
Authentication = [BasicAuthentication | PrincipalPropagation | NoAuthentication]

# Required for BAS
WebIDEEnabled = true
HTML5.DynamicDestination = true

# ABAP-Specific
WebIDEUsage = odata_abap,dev_abap
sap-client = [CLIENT_NUMBER]

# For BasicAuthentication
User = [USERNAME]
Password = [PASSWORD]
```

### Notes
- URL must be host:port only (no path)
- Virtual host/port must match Cloud Connector configuration
- sap-client is required for ABAP systems

## Template 2: SAP S/4HANA Cloud

Use for connecting to SAP S/4HANA Cloud public edition.

```properties
# Basic Configuration

## Verification Checklist

After creating a destination, verify:

- [ ] Destination name matches what you'll use in dev space
- [ ] `WebIDEEnabled = true` is set
- [ ] `HTML5.DynamicDestination = true` is set
- [ ] Correct `WebIDEUsage` value for system type
- [ ] URL format is correct (host:port for on-premise)
- [ ] Authentication credentials are valid
- [ ] Check Connection succeeds in BTP Cockpit

### From Dev Space Terminal

```bash
# Refresh destinations
curl localhost:8887/reload

# List destinations
curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations -o dests.json
```

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Destination not visible | Restart dev space after creating destination |
| Connection fails | Verify Cloud Connector for on-premise systems |
| OData catalog empty | Check sap-client value for ABAP systems |
| Authentication errors | Verify credentials and token service URLs |
