## Overview

Dev spaces are isolated cloud-based development environments functioning as Developer Virtual Appliances. Each contains:
- Tailored development tools
- Pre-installed runtimes
- Scenario-specific configurations
- Security and connectivity instruments

**Key Principle**: Select the dev space type that matches your development scenario. Extensions can be added or removed later.
