## Quick Start

### Creating a Planning-Enabled Story

1. **Create Planning Model** with required dimensions:
   - Version dimension (required)
   - Date dimension (required)
   - Account dimension (recommended)
   - Other business dimensions

2. **Add Table Widget** to story and link to planning model

3. **Enable Planning** on the table:
   - Select table → Planning panel → Enable Planning
   - Configure version selection (public or private)

4. **Configure Data Entry**:
   - Set editable measures/accounts
   - Configure spreading behavior
   - Set up validation rules

### Creating an Analytics Designer Planning Application

1. **Create Analytic Application** (not Optimized Story)
2. **Add Planning Model** as data source
3. **Add Table Widget** and enable planning
4. **Write Scripts** for:
   - Version selection
   - Data submission
   - Custom validation
   - Workflow triggers

---

## Core Concepts

### Model Types

**Planning Model**:
- Supports data write-back
- Requires Version and Date dimensions
- Enables spreading, distribution, allocation
- Supports data locking
- Used for budgeting, forecasting, planning

**Analytic Model**:
- Read-only (no write-back)
- No required dimensions
- Better performance for reporting
- Use when planning not needed

### Version Management

**Public Versions**:
- Visible to all users with access
- Shared across the organization
- Require publish to update

**Private Versions**:
- Visible only to creator (unless shared)
- Used for simulation and what-if analysis
- Can be published to public or new version

**Edit Mode**:
- Temporary private copy when editing public version
- Changes visible only to editor until published
- Automatic validation on publish

**Reference**: See `references/version-management.md` for detailed workflows.

### Planning API Overview

**getPlanning() API** - Table planning operations:
```javascript
// Check if planning is enabled
var isEnabled = Table_1.getPlanning().isEnabled();

// Get public versions
var publicVersions = Table_1.getPlanning().getPublicVersions();

// Get private version
var privateVersion = Table_1.getPlanning().getPrivateVersion();

// Set user input (data entry)
Table_1.getPlanning().setUserInput(selection, value);

// Submit data changes
Table_1.getPlanning().submitData();
```

**PlanningModel API** - Master data operations:
```javascript
// Get dimension members with properties
var members = PlanningModel_1.getMembers("CostCenter");

// Create new members
PlanningModel_1.createMembers("CostCenter", [
    {id: "CC100", description: "Marketing"}
]);

// Update existing members
PlanningModel_1.updateMembers("CostCenter", [
    {id: "CC100", description: "Marketing Dept"}
]);

// Delete members
PlanningModel_1.deleteMembers("CostCenter", ["CC100"]);
```

**DataSource API** - Filtering and querying:
```javascript
// Set dimension filter
Table_1.getDataSource().setDimensionFilter("Version",
    "[Version].[parentId].&[public.Actual]");

// Get members with booked values only
var members = Table_1.getDataSource().getMembers("Account",
    {accessMode: MemberAccessMode.BookedValues});

// Remove filter
Table_1.getDataSource().removeDimensionFilter("Version");
```

**Reference**: See `references/api-reference.md` for complete API documentation.

## Data Actions

Data actions perform calculations and data manipulation on planning models.

### Step Types

| Step Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Copy | Move data between dimensions/versions |
| Advanced Formula | Complex calculations |
| Allocation | Rule-based distribution |
| Currency Conversion | Convert currencies |
| Embedded Data Action | Run another data action |

### Creating a Copy Step

```
Source:
  Version = Actual
  Year = 2024

Target:
  Version = Budget
  Year = 2025

Mapping:
  Account = Account (same)
  CostCenter = CostCenter (same)
```

### Advanced Formula Example

```
// Calculate forecast = Actual + (Budget - Actual) * 0.5
[Version].[Forecast] = [Version].[Actual] +
    ([Version].[Budget] - [Version].[Actual]) * 0.5
```

### Parameters

Add parameters to make data actions reusable:
- **Member Parameter**: Select dimension member
- **Number Parameter**: Enter numeric value
- **String Parameter**: Enter text (2025+)
- **Datetime Parameter**: Select date/time (2025+)

**Reference**: See `references/data-actions.md` for complete configuration guide.

---

## Multi Actions

Multi actions orchestrate multiple planning operations across models and versions.

### Available Step Types

1. **Data Action Step**: Run data action with parameters
2. **Version Management Step**: Publish versions
3. **Predictive Step**: Run forecasting scenarios
4. **Data Import Step**: Import from SAP sources
5. **API Step**: Call external HTTP APIs
6. **Data Locking Step**: Lock/unlock data slices
7. **PaPM Step**: Run Profitability and Performance Management

### Example Multi Action Flow

```
1. Clean target version (Data Action)
2. Import actuals (Data Import)
3. Run forecast (Predictive)
4. Calculate allocations (Data Action)
5. Publish to public version (Version Management)
6. Lock published data (Data Locking)
```

### Cross-Model Parameters

When using public dimensions, create cross-model parameters to share values across steps in different models.

**Reference**: See `references/data-actions.md` for multi action configuration.

---

## S/4HANA ACDOCP Export

Export native planning data from SAC to SAP S/4HANA's ACDOCP table (central ERP plan data storage).

### Architecture

```
SAC Planning Model → Data Export Service → Cloud Connector → API_PLPACDOCPDATA_SRV → ACDOCP
```

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Legacy Mode** | Must be enabled on planning model |
| **OData Service** | Activate `API_PLPACDOCPDATA_SRV` in `/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE` |
| **Cloud Connector** | Required for on-premise S/4HANA |

### Required Dimensions for Export

- **Version (Plan Category)**: Only public versions can be exported
- **FiscalYearPeriod**: Mandatory in export scope
- **Measure**: Only ONE target measure per export job
- **G/L Account**: Required for ACDOCP mapping

### Export Behavior

- Exported data **overwrites existing data within scope**
- S/4HANA generates delta records for changes
- **Deletions don't propagate**: Set values to 0 and re-export to clear ACDOCP data
- Filters cannot be changed after export job creation—name jobs descriptively

### Quick Setup

1. Enable Legacy Mode on planning model
2. Create S/4HANA connection with Cloud Connector
3. Data Management → Create Data Export Job
4. Map dimensions to ACDOCP fields
5. Define export scope (FiscalYearPeriod + PlanningCategory mandatory)
6. Schedule or run export

**Reference**: See `references/s4hana-acdocp-export.md` for complete configuration guide, troubleshooting, and SAP documentation links.

## Seamless Planning with Datasphere

Seamless Planning unifies SAC planning with SAP Datasphere, enabling enterprise-grade storage and governance for plan data.

### Architecture Overview

```
SAC (Planning Logic & UX) ──Direct Persistence──► Datasphere (Data Storage & Governance)
```

**What stays in SAC**: Planning calculations, version management, data actions, calendar workflows
**What moves to Datasphere**: Fact data, public dimensions, physical storage, data governance

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Unified Data** | Centralized storage ensures consistency |
| **Direct Persistence** | Changes in SAC instantly reflect in Datasphere |
| **Optimized Resources** | Reduces SAC memory and storage footprint |
| **Enterprise Reusability** | Datasphere modeling extends to planning data |

### Prerequisites

1. **SAC tenant on SAP HANA Cloud** - Verify in System → About
2. **Co-located tenants** - Same SAP data center region
3. **1:1 tenant linkage** - One SAC tenant to one Datasphere tenant
4. **Consistent IdP** - Same SAML identity provider
5. **Datasphere space roles** - DW Modeler, DW Integrator, or DW Space Administrator

### Quick Setup

1. Create new Planning Model
2. Select **SAP Datasphere Space** as Data Storage Location
3. Configure dimensions (public dimensions stored in Datasphere)
4. Enable **Expose to Datasphere** in Model Details
5. Plan normally in SAC - changes persist automatically

### Cross-Model Planning

All models for cross-model operations (data actions, multi actions) must be in the **same Datasphere space**.

**Reference**: See `references/seamless-planning-datasphere.md` for detailed architecture, configuration, and troubleshooting.

---

## BPC Live Connection

SAC supports live data connections to BPC Embedded on S/4HANA, enabling planning with the BPC engine while using SAC's modern interface.

### Supported BPC Versions

| Version | Planning Support |
|---------|------------------|
| **BPC Embedded (S/4HANA)** | Full planning features |
| **BPC for NetWeaver** | Limited (read-only) |
| **BPC Standard** | Export to BPC required |

### Planning Features via BPC Live

- **Data Entry**: Direct input to BPC models
- **Planning Sequences**: Execute FOX scripts from SAC
- **Version Management**: BPC-controlled categories
- **Master Data Planning**: Update dimension properties
- **Data Locking**: BPC locks integration

### Running BPC Planning Sequences

```javascript
// Execute BPC planning sequence
PlanningSequence_1.setParameterValue("FISCAL_YEAR", "2025");
PlanningSequence_1.setParameterValue("VERSION", "PLAN");
PlanningSequence_1.execute().then(function() {
    Table_1.getDataSource().refreshData();
});
```

### When to Use BPC Live vs Native SAC

**Use BPC Live when**: Existing BPC investment, complex FOX scripts, integrated with BW reporting
**Use Native SAC when**: New implementation, simpler requirements, mobile-first applications

**Reference**: See `references/bpc-live-connection.md` for setup, prerequisites, and troubleshooting.

---

## Value Driver Trees

Value Driver Trees (VDT) visualize how values flow through a planning model, enabling driver-based planning and what-if analysis.

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Driver-Based Planning** | Model how prices, headcount impact revenue |
| **What-If Analysis** | Simulate scenarios, see cascading effects |
| **Strategic Planning** | Visualize value chain impacts |
| **Executive Presentations** | Touchscreen-friendly boardroom displays |

### Creating a Value Driver Tree

1. Add **Value Driver Tree** widget to story or application
2. Select planning model with Date dimension
3. Add nodes (auto-create from model or manual)
4. Configure measures and structures per node
5. Link nodes (drivers right, outcomes left)
6. Set presentation date range

### Node Configuration

| Setup | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 Account + 1 Structure** | Single row of values |
| **Multiple Accounts** | Row per account (e.g., sales + quantity) |
| **Multiple Structures** | Compare scenarios/currencies |

### JavaScript API

```javascript
// Get VDT reference
var vdt = ValueDriverTree_1;

// Get selected node value
var value = vdt.getSelectedNode().getValue("Revenue", "2025Q1");

// Collapse/expand nodes
vdt.collapseNode("Node_Revenue");
vdt.expandNode("Node_Revenue");
```

**Reference**: See `references/value-driver-trees.md` for detailed setup and best practices.

---

## Data Action Tracing

Data Action Tracing is a debugging tool for inspecting intermediate results during data action execution.

### When to Use Tracing

| Scenario | How Tracing Helps |
|----------|-------------------|
| **New Development** | Validate each step produces expected results |
| **Debugging Failures** | Identify which step causes incorrect data |
| **Performance Investigation** | See which steps process most data |
| **Allocation Debugging** | Validate driver ratios and distributions |

### Adding Tracepoints

1. Open data action in **Data Action Designer**
2. Navigate to step where you want to trace
3. Click **Add Tracepoint** (or right-click → Add Tracepoint)
4. Name descriptively (e.g., "After Copy Step", "Before Allocation")

### Running Trace Mode

1. Open data action in designer
2. Click **Run with Tracing**
3. Set required parameters
4. Execute - data captured at each tracepoint
5. Review results in **Tracing Results Panel**

### Analyzing Results

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data at Tracepoint** | All values at that point |
| **Changes Since Previous** | Delta between tracepoints |
| **Filtered View** | Focus on specific data |

### TRACE() in Advanced Formulas

```
// Add tracepoints in script
[Revenue] = [Quantity] * [Price]
TRACE("After_Revenue_Calc")

[Final] = [Revenue] * (1 + [Tax])
TRACE("After_Tax")
```

**Reference**: See `references/data-action-tracing.md` for complete debugging guide.

---

## Planning Workflows (Calendar)

The SAP Analytics Cloud calendar organizes collaborative planning processes.

### Task Types

**General Task**: Data entry by assignees
- Attach work file (story/application)
- Set due dates and notifications
- Track completion status

**Review Task**: Approval workflow
- Review results of general tasks
- Approve or reject submissions
- Automatic notification on status change

**Composite Task**: Combined entry and review
- Simplified approval for single-level workflows
- Driving dimension support for regional planning

**Data Locking Task**: Schedule lock changes
- Specify data slice to lock/unlock
- Set target lock state
- Event-based triggering

### Multi-Level Approval

```
Round 1: Regional Managers review regional plans
    ↓ (on approval)
Round 2: Finance Director reviews consolidated plan
    ↓ (on approval)
Round 3: CFO final approval
    ↓ (on approval)
Data Locking: Lock approved plan data
```

### Task Dependencies

Configure predecessor tasks to create sequential workflows:
- Review tasks automatically start when predecessor completes
- Data locking tasks trigger on approval events

**Reference**: See `references/planning-workflows.md` for calendar configuration.

---

## Spreading & Distribution

### Spreading (Vertical)

Distributes values from parent to child members:
- **Equal Spread**: Divide equally among children
- **Proportional Spread**: Maintain existing ratios
- **Automatic**: SAC determines best method

```javascript
// Spreading happens automatically when entering at aggregate level
// Example: Enter 1000 at "Total Regions" spreads to child regions
```

### Distribution (Horizontal)

Moves values between members at same hierarchy level:
- Select source and target cells
- Choose distribution method
- Apply via context menu or script

### Allocation by Rules

Configure structured allocations in data actions:
- Define driver accounts for percentage distribution
- Set allocation targets
- Execute via data action or multi action

---

## Data Locking

Protect planning data during and after planning cycles.

### Lock States

| State | Data Entry | Owner Can Edit |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Open | Yes | Yes |
| Restricted | No (except owner) | Yes |
| Locked | No | No |
| Mixed | Varies | Varies (selection contains multiple states) |

### Configuration

1. **Enable Data Locking** on planning model
2. **Define Driving Dimensions** (e.g., Region, Version)
3. **Assign Owners** to data slices
4. **Configure Lock Regions** via model settings

### Script Example

```javascript
// Get data locking object
var dataLocking = Table_1.getPlanning().getDataLocking();

// Get lock state for selection
var selection = Table_1.getSelections()[0];
var lockState = dataLocking.getState(selection);

// Check if locked
if (lockState === DataLockingState.Locked) {
    Application.showMessage("This data is locked.");
}
```

**Reference**: See `references/planning-workflows.md` for data locking patterns.

---

## Members on the Fly

Create, update, and delete dimension members dynamically at runtime.

### Supported Operations

```javascript
// Create new member
PlanningModel_1.createMembers("CostCenter", {
    id: "CC_NEW",
    description: "New Cost Center"
});

// Update existing member
PlanningModel_1.updateMembers("CostCenter", {
    id: "CC_NEW",
    description: "Updated Description"
});

// Get single member
var member = PlanningModel_1.getMember("CostCenter", "CC_NEW");

// Get members with pagination
var members = PlanningModel_1.getMembers("CostCenter", {
    offset: "0",
    limit: "100"
});
```

### Important Restrictions

- **Dimension Type**: Only "Generic" dimensions supported (NOT Account, Version, Time, Organization)
- **Refresh Required**: Call `Application.refreshData()` after member changes
- **Custom Properties**: Use prefixes to avoid naming conflicts (e.g., "CUSTOM_Region")

**Reference**: See `references/analytics-designer-planning.md` for complete API documentation.

---

## Common JavaScript Patterns

### Finding Active Version by Attribute

```javascript
var allVersions = PlanningModel_1.getMembers("Version");
var activeVersion = "";

for (var i = 0; i < allVersions.length; i++) {
    if (allVersions[i].properties.Active === "X") {
        activeVersion = allVersions[i].id;
        break;
    }
}
console.log("Active Version: " + activeVersion);
```

### Setting Filter from Planning Cycle

```javascript
Application.showBusyIndicator();
Table_1.setVisible(false);

// Find active planning cycle
var cycles = PlanningModel_1.getMembers("PlanningCycle");
var activeCycle = "";

for (var i = 0; i < cycles.length; i++) {
    if (cycles[i].properties.Flag === "ACTIVE") {
        activeCycle = cycles[i].id;
        break;
    }
}

// Apply MDX filter
Table_1.getDataSource().setDimensionFilter("Date",
    "[Date].[YQM].&[" + activeCycle + "]");

Table_1.setVisible(true);
Application.hideBusyIndicator();
```

### Version Publishing

```javascript
// Get forecast version
var forecastVersion = Table_1.getPlanning().getPublicVersion("Forecast2025");

// Check if changes need publishing
if (forecastVersion.isDirty()) {
    forecastVersion.publish();
    Application.showMessage("Version published successfully.");
}
```

### Data Action Execution

```javascript
// Execute data action with parameters
DataAction_1.setParameterValue("Version", "Budget");
DataAction_1.setParameterValue("Year", "2025");

DataAction_1.execute();

// Or execute in background
DataAction_1.executeInBackground();
```

**Reference**: See `references/javascript-patterns.md` for more examples.

## Performance Best Practices

### Data Action Optimization

1. **Use Input Controls**: Link to parameters to reduce data scope
2. **Embed Related Actions**: Combine actions on same model/version
3. **Minimize Cross-Model Operations**: Keep data in single model when possible
4. **Use Batch Processing**: Group operations in single transaction

### Story Performance

1. **Enable Data Locking Selectively**: Only on models that need it
2. **Use Growing Mode**: For large tables with pagination
3. **Limit Visible Dimensions**: Reduce data cells displayed
4. **Optimize Filters**: Apply story filters before data entry

### API Performance

1. **Use Booked Values Filter**: Retrieve only posted data
2. **Limit getMembers() Results**: Set limit parameter
3. **Cache Member Lists**: Store in script variables when reusing
4. **Use Busy Indicator**: Improve perceived performance

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Data not saving

**Check**:
1. Planning enabled on table?
2. User has planning permissions?
3. Data locked?
4. Validation rules failing?

**Debug**:
```javascript
console.log("Planning enabled: " + Table_1.getPlanning().isEnabled());
var lockState = Table_1.getPlanning().getDataLocking().getState(selection);
console.log("Lock state: " + lockState);
```

### Issue: Version not publishing

**Check**:
1. Valid changes only? (Invalid changes discarded)
2. Data access control allowing write?
3. Version not already published?

### Issue: Data action failing

**Check**:
1. Source data exists?
2. Target version writable?
3. Dimension mappings correct?
4. Parameters set correctly?

**Debug**: Use data action tracing table with "Show Only Leaves" option.

### Issue: getMembers() returns empty

**Check**:
1. Dimension name correct?
2. Model connected?
3. User has read access?
4. Using correct API (PlanningModel vs DataSource)?

## Instructions for Claude

When using this skill:

1. **Check model type first** - Ensure planning model (not analytic) for write operations
2. **Verify planning enabled** - Table must have planning enabled
3. **Use appropriate API** - PlanningModel for master data, getPlanning() for transactions
4. **Handle versions correctly** - Private for drafts, publish to public when ready
5. **Respect data locking** - Check lock state before suggesting edits
6. **Use busy indicators** - For long operations to improve UX
7. **Follow MDX syntax** - For dimension filters: `[Dim].[Hierarchy].&[Member]`
8. **Test data actions** - Use tracing before production deployment
9. **Consider performance** - Apply filters to reduce data scope
10. **Link to documentation** - Include relevant SAP Help links in responses

For troubleshooting:
- Check console for script errors
- Verify model connectivity
- Review data action logs
- Test with simplified scenarios first
- Check user permissions and data access
