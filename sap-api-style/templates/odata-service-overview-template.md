# OData Service Overview Template

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose**: Document a complete OData service with metadata, supported features, and resource listing.

**When to Use**:
- Creating documentation for an entire OData v2, v3, or v4 service
- Need to document service-level metadata, features, and entity relationships
- Providing comprehensive service overview before detailed resource documentation

**Instructions**:
1. Replace all [bracketed text] with your actual service information
2. Verify OData version and supported features against actual service metadata
3. Document complete entity data model with relationships
4. Provide accurate metadata URI and service endpoints
5. Test service metadata endpoint and verify all documented features
6. Remove optional sections if not applicable

**Cross-Reference**: Use with [OData Resource Template](#odata-resource-template) for individual resource documentation.

**Template Structure**:
- Title & Introduction
- Overview (version, root URI, permissions)
- OData Feature Support Matrix
- Entity Data Model
- Resources Table

**Token Tip**: Service-level documentation prevents repetition across resource docs, saving ~50% of tokens.

## [Service Name] OData Service

[Provide comprehensive description of the OData service. Include:
- Main purpose of the service
- What domains/business areas it covers
- Types of entities available
- Supported operations (CRUD, functions, actions)
- Integration points or workflow support]

**Example**:
"Provides OData v4 API for accessing and managing employee data including
personal information, organizational assignments, compensation details, and
organizational hierarchy. Supports full CRUD operations with complex filtering,
navigation between related entities, and advanced query capabilities."

## Overview

### OData Version

**Version**: [2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0]

[Brief explanation of which OData version(s) this service supports. Note any compatibility modes or deprecated versions.]

**Version Information**:
- OData 2.0: Legacy version with limited features
- OData 3.0: Widely supported, intermediate features
- OData 4.0: Latest version with modern features (JSON support, complex types, etc.)

**Example**:
"OData Version: 4.0

The service primarily supports OData v4.0 with modern JSON payload support,
complex filtering, and navigation properties. Backward compatibility for v3.0
available via `/odata/v3` endpoint prefix."

### Root URI

**Root URI**: `[Absolute service path, e.g., [https://api.example.com/odata/v4]`](https://api.example.com/odata/v4]`)

[Explanation of how to construct full URIs from root and include example paths to available resources.]

**Full Service Paths**:
```
Root: [https://api.example.com/odata/v4]

Available resources:
- Employees: [https://api.example.com/odata/v4/Employees]
- Departments: [https://api.example.com/odata/v4/Departments]
- Compensation: [https://api.example.com/odata/v4/Compensation]
```

### Required Permissions

**Permissions**: [List roles and what they allow across the service]

[Explain permission model and any global service-level permissions.]

**Example**:
```
Required Permissions:
- ROLE_HR_USER: Read-only access to all resources
- ROLE_HR_MANAGER: Read and write access to employee and department data
- ROLE_FINANCE: Read-only access to compensation data
- ROLE_ADMIN: Full read/write/delete access to all resources
```

**Permission Model**:
- Global service-level authentication required
- Authentication via OAuth 2.0 Bearer token
- Role-based access control (RBAC) determines allowed operations per resource
- Some resources or operations may have additional permission requirements (see resource documentation)

## OData Feature Support

Document which OData features and capabilities the service supports:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [OData Feature Name] | [Yes/No/Partial] | [Details, limits, or constraints] |

**Detailed Example**:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Filtering ($filter) | Yes | All OData comparison operators supported (eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge). Logical operators: and, or, not. String functions: contains, startswith, endswith, length, substring. Example: `$filter=FirstName eq 'John' and Status eq 'ACTIVE'` |
| Ordering ($orderby) | Yes | Ascending (asc) and descending (desc) ordering. Single and multiple field sorting. Example: `$orderby=HireDate desc,LastName asc` |
| Paging ($top, $skip) | Yes | Maximum 1000 records per request. Default page size: 50 records. Recommended: use $top with values 10-100. Example: `$top=50&$skip=100` |
| Selection ($select) | Yes | Choose specific properties to include in response. Reduces payload and improves performance. Example: `$select=FirstName,LastName,Email` |
| Expansion ($expand) | Yes | Navigate relationships with limit of 3 levels deep. Expands related entity data inline. Example: `$expand=Department,Manager($select=FirstName,LastName)` |
| Counting ($count) | Yes | Get total count of matching records via `$count` endpoint. Example: `/Employees/$count` |
| Functions | Yes | Custom business function operations available (see resource documentation for specifics). Functions return computed values. |
| Actions | Partial | Limited action support for specific state-changing operations. See resource documentation for available actions. |
| Batch Requests | Yes | Submit multiple operations in single request via `$batch` endpoint. Useful for bulk operations. |
| Batch Change Sets | Yes | Group multiple write operations (POST/PUT/PATCH) in batch change set. Atomic execution. |
| Media Resources | No | File upload/download not currently supported in this version. |
| Null Propagation | Yes | Null values properly handled in filter expressions. |
| Type Casts | Yes | Cast operations in filters (e.g., `cast(Salary, 'Edm.Decimal')`) |

**Common OData Features Explained**:
- **$filter**: Reduces result set to matching records
- **$orderby**: Controls sort order of results
- **$top/$skip**: Implements pagination
- **$select**: Reduces payload by including only needed fields
- **$expand**: Includes related entity data without separate calls
- **$count**: Gets total available records for pagination UI

This endpoint returns the complete service definition in CSDL (Common Schema Definition Language) format.
Contains entity type definitions, property types, navigation properties, and available operations.
Useful for:
- Code generation in various programming languages
- Understanding complete service structure
- Discovering available properties and relationships
- Building dynamic OData clients
```

**How to Access Metadata**:
```http
GET [https://api.example.com/odata/v4/$metadata](https://api.example.com/odata/v4/$metadata) HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Accept: application/xml
```

### Additional Model Notes

[Document any important data model constraints, patterns, or behaviors.]

**Example**:
```
- All timestamps use UTC format (ISO 8601 standard)
- Employee IDs follow strict pattern: E[0-9]{5} (example: E12345)
- Salary values stored in currency specified in Compensation entity
- Department hierarchies can nest maximum 10 levels deep
- All string properties are case-sensitive in filters
- Datetime properties include millisecond precision
- Decimal properties (salary) use 2 decimal places
- Soft deletes: Terminated employees have Status='TERMINATED' but record remains
```
