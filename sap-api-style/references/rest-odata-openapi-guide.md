## OVERVIEW OF REST AND OData APIs

### What Are REST APIs?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for building web services that enables:
- Cross-platform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations over HTTP
- Stateless client-server communication
- Resource-oriented design using URIs
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

**Key Characteristics**:
- Resources represented as URIs (e.g., `/users`, `/orders/{orderID}`)
- Stateless interactions
- HTTP methods define operations
- JSON or XML as primary data formats
- Standard HTTP status codes for responses

### What Are OData APIs?

**OData (Open Data Protocol)** is a RESTful web protocol for querying and updating data with:
- Standardized query syntax for filtering, sorting, and paging
- Consistent metadata structure
- Support for complex operations
- Strong typing and validation
- Three major versions: v2.0, v3.0, v4.01

**Key Characteristics**:
- Metadata-driven architecture
- Query language for complex data operations
- CRUD operations over HTTP
- Standard status codes and error handling
- EDM (Entity Data Model) for type definitions

### Documentation Approaches

| Aspect | REST | OData |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Specification Standard** | OpenAPI 3.0.3 (Swagger) | OData Specification (OASIS) |
| **Data Format** | JSON, XML | JSON, XML |

---

## GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR DESCRIPTIONS

### Core Principles

#### 1. Clarity and Conciseness

**Principle**: Descriptions must be clear, precise, and free of jargon.

- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid technical acronyms unless necessary
- Define unfamiliar terms
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Keep sentences relatively short

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "The ephemeral context datum manifests transient materialization paradigms"
- ✅ "Temporary data that doesn't persist after the request"

#### 2. Correct Spelling and Grammar

**Requirements**:
- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color", not "colour")
- Check for grammar errors
- Maintain consistent terminology across API
- Spell out acronyms on first use: "REST (Representational State Transfer)"

**Tools**:
- Spell checkers
- Grammar checkers (Grammarly, built-in IDE tools)
- Consistency checkers

#### 3. Formatting Standards

**Capitalization**:
- Start sentences with capital letters
- End sentences with periods
- Proper nouns always capitalized
- "API", "HTTP", "REST", "OData" in all caps

**Formatting Examples**:
- ✅ "Retrieves the user profile. Maximum request timeout is 30 seconds."
- ❌ "retrieves the user profile. maximum request timeout is 30 seconds."

#### 4. Imperative vs. Descriptive Language

**Imperative Form** (for operations):
- Start with action verb in third-person singular
- Examples: "Creates a new order", "Retrieves employee data", "Updates the configuration"
- Avoid: "This operation creates..." or "The API creates..."

**Descriptive Form** (for data types, properties):
- Use noun phrases
- Examples: "The unique order identifier", "User email address", "Product inventory count"

### Description Length Guidelines

| Element | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| API Title | 50-80 chars | 80 | Should fit single line in most contexts |
| x-sap-shortText | 100-180 chars | 180 | High-level overview for catalog |
| Operation Summary | 50-150 chars | 255 | Appears in quick reference |
| Operation Description | 100-300 chars | No limit | Additional context beyond summary |
| Parameter Description | 30-100 chars | No limit | Concise explanation of purpose |
| Response Description | 50-150 chars | No limit | Context-specific outcome description |
| Component Description | 50-200 chars | No limit | Data structure explanation |

### Common Description Patterns

#### For Operations (HTTP Endpoints)

**Pattern 1: Simple CRUD Operation**
```
Summary: "Retrieves a single user by ID"
Description: "Fetches complete user profile information including contact details, preferences, and account status."
```

**Pattern 2: Complex Operation**
```
Summary: "Searches for orders with advanced filtering"
Description: "Executes a search query returning orders matching specified criteria. Supports filtering by date range, status, customer, and amount. Results paginated with configurable page size."
```

**Pattern 3: Action/Function**
```
Summary: "Approves a pending document"
Description: "Changes document status from pending to approved and notifies relevant stakeholders. Requires manager-level permissions."
```

#### For Parameters

**Pattern 1: Simple Parameter**
```
"userId": "The unique identifier of the user"
```

**Pattern 2: Parameter with Constraints**
```
"pageSize": "Maximum number of results per page (minimum: 1, maximum: 100, default: 20)"
```

**Pattern 3: Optional Parameter**
```
"includeDetails": "If true, includes detailed breakdown; if false, returns summary only (optional, defaults to false)"
```

#### For Responses

**Pattern 1: Success Response**
```
"200 OK": "Order successfully created. Returns the new order with assigned ID and creation timestamp."
```

**Pattern 2: Error Response - Generic**
```
"400 Bad Request": "Invalid request format or missing required fields. Check error details for specific violations."
```

**Pattern 3: Error Response - Context-Specific**
```
"409 Conflict": "Cannot process order because inventory for product is insufficient. Current stock: 5 units, requested: 10 units."
```

### Documentation Quality Guidelines

#### ✅ Good Parameter Descriptions

```
"The unique employee identifier"
"Filter by status (Open, In Progress, Closed)"
"Number of results per page (1-100, default 20)"
"Search query string (minimum 2 characters)"
"Include subordinate employee records (optional, defaults to false)"
```

#### ❌ Poor Parameter Descriptions

```
"ID"                                    # Too vague
"The status"                           # Obvious, doesn't add value
"This parameter filters results"       # Doesn't explain what it filters
"Required to be provided"              # Type already indicates required
"See documentation"                    # No helpful information
```

### Parameter Organization

**Recommended Order in Documentation**:
1. Path parameters (required)
2. Query parameters (often optional filters)
3. Header parameters
4. Cookie parameters
5. Body parameters (request payload)

**Within Each Category**:
- Required parameters first
- Optional parameters after
- Alphabetical by name within sub-category

## RESPONSES DOCUMENTATION

### Response Overview

**Responses** describe what the API returns for different scenarios:
- Success codes (2xx)
- Client errors (4xx)
- Server errors (5xx)

Each response includes status code and description of outcome.

### Response Structure

#### 1. HTTP Status Code

**Purpose**: Indicates success or type of failure

**Common Status Codes for REST APIs**:

| Code | Status | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **2xx** | **Success** | Request processed successfully |
| 200 | OK | GET, PATCH success; data returned |
| 201 | Created | POST successful; new resource created |
| 202 | Accepted | Async operation queued for processing |
| 204 | No Content | DELETE, POST success; no body |
| **3xx** | **Redirection** | Client action needed for completion |
| 301 | Moved Permanently | Resource permanently moved |
| 304 | Not Modified | Data unchanged since last request |
| **4xx** | **Client Error** | Invalid request or missing data |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid format or missing required field |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required or invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden | Authenticated but insufficient permission |
| 404 | Not Found | Requested resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Request conflicts with current state |
| **5xx** | **Server Error** | Server processing failed |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily unavailable |

#### 2. Response Description

**Field**: `description`

**Requirements**:
- Required for every response code
- Explains outcome in plain language
- Context-specific, not generic
- Describes returned data (if applicable)
- Mentions implications of status

**Guidelines**:
- Begins with capital letter
- **Avoid generic descriptions**: "No content", "Not found"
- **Use specific descriptions**: "Product out of stock", "Employee record not found"
- Mentions returned format (JSON, empty body)
- Explains business context

#### 3. Response Body

**Field**: `content`

**Includes**:
- Media type (application/json, application/xml)
- Schema definition
- Example response data

          requiredRole: "HR_Manager"
          yourRole: "HR_User"
```

### Response Documentation Best Practices

#### ✅ Effective Response Descriptions

```
"Employee successfully created with assigned ID. Location header contains URL to new resource."
"Product is out of stock. Check available inventory levels in the system."
"Invalid request format. Email field must be in user@example.com format."
"Insufficient permissions. Only managers can approve documents. Contact HR for role assignment."
"Order cannot be modified because it's already been shipped. Contact customer service for options."
```

#### ❌ Poor Response Descriptions

```
"OK"                                              # Too generic
"No content"                                      # Doesn't explain context
"Bad request"                                     # Doesn't explain what's bad
"Not found"                                       # Doesn't explain what wasn't found
"Error"                                           # No helpful information
"See error details"                               # Doesn't describe status code
```

### Response Error Handling

#### Standard Error Response Schema

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Error:
      type: object
      required:
        - errorCode
        - message
      properties:
        errorCode:
          type: string
          description: "Machine-readable error code for programmatic handling"
          example: "INVALID_INPUT"
        message:
          type: string
          description: "Human-readable error message"
          example: "Email field is required and must be valid"
        details:
          type: array
          description: "Detailed information about each error"
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              field:
                type: string
                description: "Field that caused the error"
              issue:
                type: string
                description: "Specific problem with the field"
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: "When error occurred"
```

#### Error Response Documentation Template

```yaml
responses:
  '400':
    description: "[Brief status]. [Explanation of what went wrong]. [How to fix]"
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Error"
        example:
          errorCode: "[SPECIFIC_CODE]"
          message: "[Context-specific message]"
          details: [...]
```

## COMPONENTS AND DEFINITIONS

### What Are Components?

**Components** (in OpenAPI 3.0) define reusable data structures:
- Request/response body schemas
- Parameter definitions
- Response headers
- Security schemes
- Examples

Also called **Definitions** in OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger).

### Schema Documentation

#### Schema Object Structure

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Employee:
      type: object
      required:
        - employeeId
        - firstName
        - lastName
      properties:
        employeeId:
          type: string
          description: "Unique employee identifier assigned by system"
          example: "E12345"

        firstName:
          type: string
          description: "Employee's first name"
          minLength: 1

          example: "Engineering"

        salary:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: "Annual salary in USD (minimum $20,000)"
          minimum: 20000
          example: 85000.00

- Explain primary purpose
- Mention key characteristics

**For Properties (Fields)**:
- Concise description of property meaning
- Explain constraints (min/max, format, allowed values)
- Provide example value
- Mention relationships to other fields

**Naming Conventions**:

| Schema Type | Naming | Examples |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Request Body** | Use operation-specific name | `CreateEmployeeRequest`, `UpdateEmployeeRequest` |
| **Response Body** | Use resource name | `Employee`, `Order`, `Document` |
| **Collection** | Plural form | `Employees`, `Orders`, `Documents` |
| **Error** | Error-specific name | `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError` |

## SECURITY SCHEMES

### What Are Security Schemes?

**Security Schemes** define how APIs authenticate requests:
- Bearer tokens (OAuth 2.0)
- API keys
- Basic authentication
- OpenID Connect

### Common SAP API Security Schemes

#### 1. OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token

**Use Case**: Cloud applications, third-party integrations

**Flow Type**: Client Credentials, Authorization Code, etc.

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OAuth2ClientCredentials:
      type: oauth2
      description: "OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication"
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: "[https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token"](https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token")
          refreshUrl: "[https://auth.sap.com/oauth/refresh"](https://auth.sap.com/oauth/refresh")
          scopes:
            "employees:read": "Read employee data"
            "employees:write": "Create/modify employee data"
            "employees:delete": "Delete employee records"
```

#### 2. API Key Authentication

**Use Case**: Simple API access, testing

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
      description: "API key authentication for direct API access. Obtain key from SAP API Business Hub"
```

#### 3. Basic Authentication

**Use Case**: Legacy systems, simple auth

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      description: "HTTP Basic authentication using username:password encoded in Authorization header"
```

#### 4. OpenID Connect

**Use Case**: Enterprise single sign-on

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OpenIDConnect:
      type: openIdConnect
      openIdConnectUrl: "[https://auth.sap.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"](https://auth.sap.com/.well-known/openid-configuration")
      description: "OpenID Connect authentication for enterprise environments"
```

### Security Scheme Application

#### Apply to All Operations

```yaml
security:
  - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
      - "employees:read"
      - "employees:write"
```

#### Apply to Specific Operations

```yaml
paths:
  /employees:
    get:
      security:
        - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
            - "employees:read"
      # ...

    post:
      security:
        - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
            - "employees:write"
      # ...
```

### Security Documentation Best Practices

#### ✅ Good Security Documentation

```
"OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication.
Obtain access token from [https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token](https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token) using your client credentials.
Include token in Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

#### ❌ Poor Security Documentation

```
"OAuth 2.0"                          # Too vague
"Use authentication"                 # No details
"See SAP documentation"              # No specifics
```

## TAGS

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are labels that group related operations for organization in documentation:
- Organize operations by resource type
- Create documentation structure
- Improve API navigation

### Tag Definition and Usage

#### Tag Object Structure

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Employees"
    description: "Operations for managing employee records including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions"
    externalDocs:
      description: "Employee Management Guide"
      url: "[https://help.sap.com/employees"](https://help.sap.com/employees")

  - name: "Departments"
    description: "Operations for querying and managing department structures and assignments"
    externalDocs:
      description: "Organization Guide"
      url: "[https://help.sap.com/departments"](https://help.sap.com/departments")

  - name: "Compensation"
    description: "Operations for managing salary, benefits, and compensation-related data"
```

#### Applying Tags to Operations

```yaml
paths:
  /employees:
    post:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Create a new employee"
      # ...

  /employees/{employeeId}:
    get:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Retrieve employee details"
      # ...

    patch:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Update employee information"
      # ...

  /employees/{employeeId}/compensation:
    get:
      tags:
        - "Compensation"
      summary: "Get employee compensation details"
      # ...
```

### Tag Documentation Guidelines

#### Tag Name

**Requirements**:
- Clear, noun-based names (not verbs)
- Follows resource/domain structure
- Singular or plural consistently
- Capitalized properly

**Examples**:

```
✓ "Employees", "Orders", "Travel Requests", "Expenses"
✗ "Create Employee", "Get Orders", "employee management"
```

#### Tag Description

**Requirements**:
- 1-2 sentences explaining tag's scope
- Explains what operations it contains
- Lists related operations or domains
- Provides context for developers

**Examples**:

```
"Operations for managing employee records including personal information, assignments, and employment status"

"CRUD operations for purchase orders including creation, approval workflows, and fulfillment tracking"

"Query and manage organizational structure, department hierarchies, and cost center allocations"
```

### Tag Organization Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Resource-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Employees"
  - name: "Departments"
  - name: "Compensation"
  - name: "Benefits"
```

#### Pattern 2: Domain-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Human Resources"
  - name: "Procurement"
  - name: "Finance"
  - name: "Supply Chain"
```

#### Pattern 3: Operation-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Read Operations"
  - name: "Write Operations"
  - name: "Administrative Operations"
```

## BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

### Documentation Quality Principles

#### 1. Clarity First

- Write descriptions for developers without API context
- Use simple, direct language
- Define technical terms
- Provide practical examples

#### 2. Completeness

- Document every operation, parameter, and response
- Include all status codes (success and error)
- Explain what data is returned
- Describe error scenarios

#### 3. Consistency

- Use consistent terminology across API
- Follow naming conventions strictly
- Maintain uniform description style
- Organize information predictably

#### 4. Context-Specificity

- Avoid generic error descriptions
- Explain business context
- Describe constraints and limitations
- Mention prerequisites or requirements

#### 5. Usability

- Organize information logically
- Group related operations with tags
- Cross-reference related endpoints
- Provide practical examples

### Writing Quality Checklist

Before publishing API documentation, verify:

- [ ] Every operation has meaningful summary (max 255 chars)
- [ ] Operation descriptions provide supplementary context
- [ ] All parameters documented with clear descriptions
- [ ] Every status code explained with context-specific description
- [ ] Success responses show data structure and example

## CHARACTER LIMIT REFERENCE TABLE

### Quick Reference: Character Limits for All API Elements

| Element | Max Chars | Notes | Example |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **API Title** | 80 | OpenAPI info.title | "Employee Central" (17 chars) |
| **x-sap-shortText** | 180 | SAP-specific high-level description | "Create, update, and query..." (82 chars) |
| **Operation Summary** | 255 | Appears in operation list | "Retrieve employee by ID" (23 chars) |
| **Package Title** | No strict limit | Catalog display | "SAP SuccessFactors..." |
| **Package Short Desc** | 250 | Not counting spaces | Typical 60-120 chars |
| **Parameter Name** | Language dependent | Matches spec | "employeeId" |
| **Parameter Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-100 | "Employee unique identifier" |
| **Property Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-80 | "User email address" |
| **Error Description** | No strict limit | Recommended 50-150 | "Cannot process order..." |
| **Enum Value Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-80 | "Active employment status" |

### Practical Counting Examples

**For Package Short Description (max 250 chars, not counting spaces)**:

```
Original: "Create, update, and query employee records including personal
           information, organizational assignments, and compensation data"

Count (no spaces): Create,update,andqueryemployeerecordsincludingpersonal...
Character count: 119 ✓ (GOOD - well under 250)
```

**For x-sap-shortText (max 180 chars)**:

```
Original: "Query and manage employee master data, assignments, and
           compensation information with real-time synchronization"

Count: 118 characters ✓ (GOOD - under 180 limit)
```

**For Operation Summary (max 255 chars)**:

```
Original: "Searches for matching orders with advanced filtering by date,
           status, and amount with results pagination"

Count: 118 characters ✓ (GOOD - under 255 limit)
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Naming Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Including Technical Specifics

```
"SAP Employee Central REST API v2.0"
```

**Problem**: Technical specifications shouldn't be in name
**Fix**: "Employee Central"

#### ❌ Using API Type in Name

```
"Purchase Order OData Service"
```

**Problem**: API type is implicit
**Fix**: "Purchase Orders"

#### ❌ Starting with SAP Prefix

```
"SAP Human Resources Employee Management"
```

**Problem**: Redundant context
**Fix**: "Employee Management" (in HR context)

#### ❌ Using Verbs Instead of Nouns

```
"Managing Employee Data"
```

**Problem**: Not a clear entity name
**Fix**: "Employee Data" or "Employee Management"

---

### Description Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Second-Person Language

```
❌ "You can create a new employee"
✅ "Creates a new employee"

❌ "You need to provide the employee ID"
✅ "Requires employee ID in path parameter"
```

#### ❌ Repeating Summary Information

```
Operation Summary: "Creates a new order"

❌ Description: "This operation creates a new order in the system"
✅ Description: "Automatically assigns order number and sends confirmation to customer"
```

#### ❌ Generic Error Descriptions

```
❌ "Bad Request"
❌ "Not Found"
❌ "Server Error"

✅ "Email field must be in user@example.com format"
✅ "No employee found with ID E99999"
✅ "Database temporarily unavailable. Try again in 60 seconds"
```

#### ❌ Including Implementation Details

```
❌ "Calls internal service to validate employee"
✅ "Validates employee against company records"

❌ "Queries three database tables and joins results"
✅ "Retrieves complete employee profile with all departments"
```

#### ❌ Vague Language

```
❌ "Handles employee information"
✅ "Creates, updates, and deletes employee records"

❌ "Returns data"
✅ "Returns array of employees matching search criteria"

❌ "May fail in some cases"
✅ "Returns 409 Conflict if employee email already exists"
```

---

### Parameter Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Obvious Descriptions

```
❌ "The employeeId"
❌ "The status field"
❌ "Required parameter"

✅ "The unique employee identifier"
✅ "Employment status (Active, Inactive, OnLeave)"
✅ "Employee ID required in URL path"
```

```

---

### Response Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ No Context

```
❌ "OK"
❌ "Created"
❌ "Bad Request"

✅ "Employee successfully created. Location header contains URL to new resource"
✅ "Employee record not found. Verify employee ID is correct"
✅ "Email field must be valid format (user@example.com)"
```

#### ❌ Missing Error Explanation

```
❌ 400 Bad Request: "Bad request"
✅ 400 Bad Request: "Invalid request format. Email must be in user@example.com format"

❌ 404 Not Found: "Not found"
✅ 404 Not Found: "No employee found with ID E99999"

❌ 409 Conflict: "Conflict"
✅ 409 Conflict: "Cannot process because inventory insufficient. Available: 5 units, Requested: 10 units"
```

#### ❌ Inconsistent Response Structure

```
❌ Some 201 responses show created resource
❌ Some 201 responses show empty body

✅ Consistent structure across all creation endpoints
✅ Document what's returned in each case
```

---

### Schema Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Missing Property Descriptions

```
❌ properties:
    employeeId: {}
    name: {}
    email: {}

✅ properties:
    employeeId:
      description: "System-assigned unique identifier"
    name:
      description: "Employee full name"
    email:
      description: "Corporate email address"
```

#### ❌ Not Explaining Constraints

```
❌ salary:
    type: number

✅ salary:
    type: number
    description: "Annual salary in USD"
    minimum: 20000
    example: 85000.00
```

#### ❌ Unclear Enum Values

```
❌ status:
    enum: ["A", "I", "L"]

✅ status:
    enum: ["Active", "Inactive", "OnLeave"]
    description: "Employee status. Active = currently employed, Inactive = no longer employed, OnLeave = temporary leave"
```

---

### Organization Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Inconsistent Tag Usage

```
❌ Operation 1: tags: ["Employees"]
❌ Operation 2: tags: ["Employee"]
❌ Operation 3: tags: ["Employee Management"]

✅ All operations consistently use: ["Employees"]
```

#### ❌ Missing Related Links

```
❌ No cross-references between related operations
✅ Link GET to POST, PUT, DELETE for same resource

❌ Orphaned operations with no tag
✅ Every operation tagged for organization
```

#### ❌ Poor External Documentation

```
❌ externalDocs:
    description: "Documentation"
    url: "[https://help.sap.com"](https://help.sap.com")

✅ externalDocs:
    description: "Employee onboarding workflow guide"
    url: "[https://help.sap.com/guides/employee-onboarding"](https://help.sap.com/guides/employee-onboarding")
```

---

### Security Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Unclear Security Requirements

```
❌ No security schemes defined

✅ Clear OAuth 2.0 configuration with token URL and scopes

❌ Security scheme documented but not applied to operations

✅ Security applied to all operations and documented
```

#### ❌ Generic Scope Names

```
❌ scopes:
    "api": "API access"
    "read": "Read access"

✅ scopes:
    "employees:read": "Read employee data"
    "employees:write": "Create and modify employee data"
    "employees:delete": "Delete employee records"
```

---

### Example Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Unrealistic Examples

```
❌ Example with fake/obvious data that doesn't match real API
❌ Example missing required fields
❌ Example with incorrect data types

✅ Real-world example with all required fields
✅ Data types match schema definition
✅ Values realistic and properly formatted
```

#### ❌ Missing Examples

```
❌ No request body example for POST operation
❌ No error response example
❌ No filtering/pagination example

✅ Complete request and response examples
✅ Show both success and error scenarios
✅ Demonstrate complex features
```
