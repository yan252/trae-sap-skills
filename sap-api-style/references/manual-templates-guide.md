## OVERVIEW OF MANUAL DOCUMENTATION

### What Is Manual API Documentation?

Manual API documentation is custom-written reference content created when:
- Auto-generated documentation doesn't meet product requirements
- API documentation needs to be integrated into developer guides
- Custom documentation structure and presentation is required
- Documentation control and customization is a priority

### Auto-Generated vs Manual Documentation

| Aspect | Auto-Generated | Manual |
|--------|---|---|
| **Source** | OpenAPI specs, code annotations | Written documentation files |
| **Customization** | Limited to spec structure | Full control over structure and content |
| **Maintenance** | Updates with code changes | Manual synchronization needed |
| **Location** | Separate documentation portal | Integrated into guides |
| **Use Case** | Standard API catalogs | Custom developer guides |
| **Completeness** | Technical accuracy guaranteed | Requires careful review |

### Key Principle: Two-Tier Organization

Both REST and OData manual documentation follow a hierarchical approach:
1. **Level 1**: Overview (service/resource grouping)
2. **Level 2+**: Detailed documentation (methods/resources/operations)

This prevents redundancy and improves navigation.

---

## WHEN TO USE MANUAL TEMPLATES

Use manual documentation templates when:

1. **Documentation Doesn't Match Product Needs**
   - Auto-generated structure doesn't align with your service
   - Need custom grouping and organization

2. **Integration into Developer Guides**
   - API documentation must be embedded in larger guides
   - Single-document strategy preferred over separate catalogs

3. **Custom Presentation Requirements**
   - Need specific formatting or layout
   - Want to control example placement and detail level

4. **Complex Multi-Part Services**
   - Large services with many related resources
   - Clear hierarchy needed for navigation

5. **Regulatory or Compliance Requirements**
   - Documentation control is mandatory
   - Version tracking within guides is essential

## REST API TEMPLATES

### Overview: REST Two-Level Structure

REST API documentation uses a 2-level hierarchy:
- **Level 1: REST API Overview** - Documents related REST methods for same resource
- **Level 2: REST API Method** - Documents individual REST methods/endpoints

### REST API Overview Template (Level 1)

The Overview Template documents a set of related REST methods that apply to the same resource or service.

#### Template Sections

##### 1. Title and Introduction

**Format**: Descriptive title of the REST API or resource
**Description**: Short description of the REST API or set of REST methods that apply to the same resource

**Example Title**:
```
Employees REST API
```

**Example Description**:
```
Provides methods to retrieve, create, update, and delete employee records.
Supports querying employees by department, status, and other criteria.
```

##### 2. Base Information

**Base URI**
- Absolute endpoint where API is hosted
- Example: `[https://api.example.com/v1/employees`](https://api.example.com/v1/employees`)
- Include protocol, host, and path prefix

**Permissions**
- Required roles/permissions to access API
- List by operation type (read, write, delete)
- Example: "Requires HR_MANAGER or ADMIN role"

**Additional Context**
- Notes about API usage and scope
- Any prerequisites for calling the API

**Template Structure**:
```
## Base Information

Base URI: [Absolute URI, e.g., [https://api.example.com/v1]](https://api.example.com/v1])

Permissions: [Required permissions, e.g., ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN]

Additional Notes: [Any important context about the API]
```

##### 3. Methods Section

**Purpose**: Catalog all available HTTP methods for the resource

**Table Structure**:
| HTTP Method | Action | URI |
|---|---|---|
| [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH] | [Link to detailed method doc] | [Relative URI] |

**Detailed Example**:
| HTTP Method | Action | URI |
|---|---|---|
| GET | [List All Employees](#list-all-employees) | `/employees` |
| GET | [Get Employee by ID](#get-employee-by-id) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |
| POST | [Create Employee](#create-employee) | `/employees` |
| PUT | [Update Employee](#update-employee) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |
| DELETE | [Delete Employee](#delete-employee) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |

**Best Practices**:
- Actions should be links to detailed method documentation
- URIs are relative to Base URI
- Order by operation type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Use consistent URI naming conventions

##### 4. Common Request Headers Documentation

**Purpose**: Document HTTP headers used in requests to the API

**Table Structure**:
| Header Name | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Header name] | [Yes/No] | [Description with possible/default values] |

**Common Headers Example**:
| Header Name | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authorization | Yes | Bearer token for authentication. Format: `Authorization: Bearer {token}` |
| Content-Type | Yes | Media type of request body. Value: `application/json` |
| Accept | No | Preferred response format. Default: `application/json` |
| X-Request-ID | No | Optional request ID for tracking. Any UUID format accepted |

**Field Descriptions**:
- **Header Name**: Exact header name as expected (case-sensitive)
- **Required**: Yes if header must be present, No if optional
- **Description**: Explain purpose, format, constraints, and default values if applicable

##### 5. Common Response Headers Documentation

**Purpose**: Document HTTP headers that appear in responses

**Table Structure**:
| Header Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [Header name] | [Purpose and possible values] |

**Common Response Headers Example**:
| Header Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Content-Type | Type of response body. Value: `application/json` |
| X-Total-Count | Total number of resources available (for paginated responses) |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | Number of API calls remaining in current rate limit window |
| Location | URL of newly created resource (returned by POST operations creating resources) |

##### 6. Status Codes Section

**Purpose**: Catalog all possible HTTP status codes returned by the API

**Table Structure**:
| Status Code | Result Description |
|---|---|
| [2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx] | [What this status means in context of your API] |

**Common Status Codes Example**:

Success Codes:
| Status Code | Result Description |
|---|---|
| 200 OK | Request successful. Response body contains requested data |
| 201 Created | Resource successfully created. Location header contains URL to new resource |
| 204 No Content | Request successful. No response body returned (typically for DELETE) |

Error Codes:
| Status Code | Result Description |
|---|---|
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request format or missing required fields |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication required or token invalid/expired |
| 403 Forbidden | Authenticated but insufficient permissions for resource |
| 404 Not Found | Requested resource doesn't exist |
| 409 Conflict | Request conflicts with current state (e.g., duplicate creation) |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server encountered unexpected error |

### REST API Templates - Usage Guidelines

#### Two-Level Organization

**Level 1 - Overview Template**:
- Use for overview of related REST API methods that apply to the same resource or belong to the same service
- Contains shared information (base URI, permissions, common headers)
- Includes method list with links to detailed documentation

**Level 2 - Method Template**:
- Use for documenting individual REST API endpoints
- Contains method-specific details
- Should not repeat information from Overview

#### Best Practices for REST Templates

1. **Organize by Resource or Service**
   - Group related methods under unified overview documentation
   - Don't treat each endpoint in isolation
   - Example: All employee methods together, all department methods together

2. **Separate Common from Specific Information**
   - Place authentication, base URLs, common parameters in Overview
   - Reserve Method templates for endpoint-specific content
   - Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability

3. **Maintain Clear Navigation**
   - Overview documents must include list of methods with links to detailed docs
   - Method docs should link back to Overview
   - Help users navigate between related endpoints

4. **Consistent Structure**
   - Follow standardized templates exactly
   - Ensures documentation quality across API
   - Developers become familiar with format

5. **Complete Parameter Documentation**
   - Always specify parameter location (Path/Query/Body/Header)
   - Include constraints (min/max, patterns, valid values)
   - Document default values
   - Explain what each parameter controls

6. **Contextual Status Code Descriptions**
   - Don't just list codes—explain what they mean for THIS method
   - Example: "200 OK: Employee successfully retrieved with full profile"
   - Not just: "200 OK: Request successful"

7. **Real Examples**
   - Provide working request/response examples
   - Use realistic data that matches parameter documentation
   - Show common use cases and error scenarios

---

## OData API TEMPLATES

### Overview: OData Three-Level Structure

OData API documentation uses a 3-level hierarchy:
- **Level 1: OData Service Overview** - Describes entire OData service
- **Level 2: OData Resource** - Documents individual resources/entity sets
- **Level 3: OData Operation** - Documents single operations on resources

---

### OData Service Overview Template (Level 1)

The Service Overview Template documents a complete OData service with metadata and resource listing.

#### Template Sections

##### 1. Title and Introduction

**Format**: Service Name
**Content**: Brief description of the OData service

**Example Title**:
```
Employees OData Service
```

**Example Description**:
```
Provides OData v4 API for accessing and managing employee data including
personal information, organizational assignments, and compensation details.
Supports full CRUD operations with complex filtering and navigation.
```

##### 2. Overview Section

**2.1 OData Version**

Specify which OData version(s) the service supports:
```
OData Version: 4.0 | 3.0 | 2.0
```

Different versions have different capabilities:
- **OData 4.0**: Latest version with modern features
- **OData 3.0**: Older but widely supported version
- **OData 2.0**: Legacy version (limited features)

**Example**:
```
OData Version: 4.0 (with 3.0 backward compatibility available via `/odata/v3` endpoint)
```

**2.2 Root URI**

Absolute URI where OData service is accessible:
```
Root URI: [Absolute service path]
```

Include:
- Protocol (https://)
- Host
- Service path
- Example: `[https://api.example.com/odata/v4/employees`](https://api.example.com/odata/v4/employees`)

**Example**:
```
Root URI: `[https://api.example.com/odata/v4`](https://api.example.com/odata/v4`)

Service endpoints:
- Employees: `/odata/v4/Employees`
- Departments: `/odata/v4/Departments`
- Compensation: `/odata/v4/Compensation`
```

**2.3 Permissions and Roles**

Required permissions to access the OData service:
```
Required Permissions: [List roles and what they allow]
```

**Example**:
```
Required Permissions:
- ROLE_HR_USER: Read access to all resources
- ROLE_HR_MANAGER: Read and write access to employee data
- ROLE_FINANCE: Read access to compensation data only
```

**2.4 OData Feature Support Matrix**

Document which OData features the service supports:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Filtering ($filter) | Yes | All comparison operators supported |
| Ordering ($orderby) | Yes | Ascending and descending |
| Paging ($top, $skip) | Yes | Maximum 1000 records per request |
| Selection ($select) | Yes | Choose specific properties |
| Expansion ($expand) | Yes | Limited to 2 levels deep |
| Functions | Yes | Custom business logic operations |
| Actions | No | Not implemented in this version |
| Batch Requests | No | Each request handled individually |
| Metadata Filtering | Yes | Via $metadata endpoint |

**Template**:
```
## OData Feature Support

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Feature name] | Yes/No/Partial | [Any specific details or constraints] |
```

##### 3. Entity Data Model Section

**3.1 Entity Relationship Diagram**

Document the data model visually or with description:
```
Include diagram or detailed description of entity relationships:
- Entity types
- Navigation properties
- Associations
```

**Example Description**:
```
The service includes the following entity types:
- Employee: Contains personal and employment information
  - Has relationship to Department (Navigation: Department)
  - Has relationship to Manager (Navigation: Manager)
  - Has relationship to Compensation (Navigation: Compensation)

- Department: Contains organization structure
  - Has relationship to Employees (Navigation: Employees)
  - Has relationship to Parent Department (Navigation: ParentDepartment)

- Compensation: Contains salary and benefits
  - Has relationship to Employee (Navigation: Employee)
```

**3.2 Service Metadata URI**

Endpoint to retrieve service metadata:
```
Service Metadata URI: [Root URI]/$metadata
```

The $metadata endpoint provides:
- Entity definitions and properties
- Navigation properties and relationships
- OData function and action definitions
- Service capabilities

**Example**:
```
Service Metadata URI: `[https://api.example.com/odata/v4/$metadata`](https://api.example.com/odata/v4/$metadata`)

This endpoint returns the complete service definition in CSDL (Common Schema Definition Language) format.
Useful for code generation and understanding the full service structure.
```

**3.3 Additional Model Notes**

Any important information about the data model:
- Property constraints
- Complex types
- Computed properties
- Inheritance structures

**Example**:
```
## Additional Model Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC format (ISO 8601)
- Employee IDs follow pattern: E[0-9]{5}
- Salary values are in local currency as specified in Compensation entity
- Department hierarchies can nest up to 10 levels deep
```

##### 4. Resources Section

**Purpose**: List all entity sets available in the service

**Table Structure** (can have multiple tables organized by category):

### OData API Templates - Usage Guidelines

#### Three-Level Organization

**Level 1 - Service Overview**:
- Use for overview of an entire OData service
- Contains service purpose, metadata, supported OData versions
- Lists all available resources with links
- Documents OData feature support matrix
- Appropriate for entire service documentation

**Level 2 - Resource Documentation**:
- Use for individual resources/entity sets within the service
- Contains resource-specific information
- Lists all operations on the resource (CRUD and custom)
- Links to detailed operation documentation
- Organizes navigation properties and relationships

**Level 3 - Operation Details**:
- Use for documenting single operations on resources
- Contains operation-specific request/response information
- Includes request parameters, headers, status codes
- Provides complete request/response examples
- Detailed error handling and edge cases

#### Best Practices for OData Templates

1. **Hierarchical Organization**
   - Structure documentation from broad service down to granular operations
   - Service overview → Resource → Operation
   - Each level references next through links
   - Users navigate from general to specific information

2. **Contextual Information at Each Level**

   **Service Level**:
   - Overall service purpose
   - Supported OData versions and features
   - Service metadata endpoint
   - Permissions required across service
   - Entity relationships and data model

   **Resource Level**:
   - Resource-specific permissions
   - All operations on resource (CRUD + custom)
   - Navigation properties
   - Links to detailed operation docs

   **Operation Level**:
   - Operation-specific details
   - Exact request/response format
   - Complete working examples
   - Error scenarios with examples

3. **Clear Cross-Linking**
   - Service overview links to resources
   - Resources link to operations
   - Operations link back to resources/service
   - Related operations cross-referenced

4. **Complete Filtering Examples**
   - Show $filter syntax examples
   - Document filter operators supported
   - Explain navigation expansion ($expand)
   - Demonstrate paging ($top, $skip)
   - Show property selection ($select)

5. **Navigation Property Documentation**
   - List all navigation properties per resource
   - Show how to expand relationships
   - Document related resources
   - Include examples of navigation URIs

6. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Use exact property names from metadata
   - Match terminology across levels
   - Explain OData-specific concepts
   - Define custom functions/actions clearly

7. **Real Working Examples**
   - Every operation should have working examples
   - Show request with headers and body
   - Include complete response with headers
   - Demonstrate error scenarios
   - Use realistic data matching property types

8. **Error Handling**
   - Document all possible status codes per operation
   - Provide context-specific error descriptions
   - Include error response examples
   - Explain how to handle and recover from errors

## TEMPLATE COMPARISON TABLE

### REST vs OData Structure

| Aspect | REST | OData |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Hierarchy** | 2 levels: Overview + Method | 3 levels: Service + Resource + Operation |
| **Entity Naming** | Plural (e.g., `/employees`) | Entity Set (e.g., `/Employees`) |
| **Documentation Structure** | Resource-focused | Service-focused with deep hierarchy |
| **Filtering** | Custom query parameters | Standardized OData $filter, $orderby |
| **Paging** | limit/offset or page params | $top, $skip parameters |
| **Selection** | Custom implementation | $select parameter (standard) |
| **Navigation** | Via nested endpoints | Via $expand property (standard) |
| **Metadata** | Optional, no standard location | Required at $metadata endpoint |
| **Status Code Usage** | Full range (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) | Primarily 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| **Best Use Case** | General-purpose APIs | Data-centric services and entity operations |
| **Version Support** | N/A | Multiple versions (2.0, 3.0, 4.0) |

### Template Requirements Comparison

| Requirement | REST Overview | REST Method | OData Service | OData Resource | OData Operation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base URI | Required | Inherited | Required | Inherited | Inherited |
| Permissions | Required | Optional | Required | Required | Required |
| Status Codes | Complete list | Per-method | General list | General list | Per-operation |
| Parameters table | N/A | Required | N/A | N/A | Required |
| Examples | Optional | Highly recommended | N/A | Suggested | Required |
| Metadata reference | N/A | N/A | Required | Optional | N/A |
| Navigation info | N/A | N/A | Listed | Links table | References |
| OData features | N/A | N/A | Support matrix | N/A | N/A |

## BEST PRACTICES

### Documentation Quality Standards

1. **Completeness**
   - Document every method/operation
   - Include all status codes with context
   - Provide request and response examples
   - Explain error scenarios

2. **Clarity**
   - Use simple, direct language
   - Avoid technical jargon without explanation
   - Provide context for business logic
   - Explain constraints and limitations

3. **Consistency**
   - Follow template structure exactly
   - Use consistent terminology throughout
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Organize information predictably

4. **Accuracy**
   - Verify all examples work as documented
   - Keep parameter information current
   - Update when API behavior changes
   - Test scenarios before documenting

5. **Navigation**
   - Provide clear links between levels
   - Help users find related information
   - Cross-reference related operations
   - Use consistent anchor names

### Template Customization Guidelines

These are generic templates that should be customized:

1. **Remove Irrelevant Sections**
   - If API doesn't use authentication, simplify permission docs
   - If no custom headers, remove from template
   - If no custom functions/actions, remove from OData resource

2. **Add Missing Details**
   - Include any API-specific features
   - Add custom headers or parameters unique to your API
   - Document business rules specific to your service
   - Include rate limits, quotas, or special constraints

3. **Organize by Your Structure**
   - Group related methods logically
   - Use categories that match your service design
   - Include index/navigation appropriate for your docs
   - Reference your actual service endpoints

4. **Match Your Standards**
   - Use your company's style guide
   - Follow your documentation conventions
   - Match your existing documentation structure
   - Incorporate your terminology

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Examples**
   - Always include complete request with headers
   - Show both success and error responses
   - Use realistic, non-dummy data
   - Include actual status codes

2. **Generic Status Descriptions**
   - Not just "400 Bad Request"
   - Explain what was wrong with this operation
   - Provide guidance on how to fix
   - Use operation-specific context

3. **Missing Parameter Details**
   - Always include parameter location (Path/Query/Body)
   - Document constraints (min/max, format, valid values)
   - Explain defaults
   - Show example values

4. **Undocumented Relationships**
   - For OData: List all navigation properties
   - Show examples of navigation URIs
   - Explain cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many)
   - Document expansion examples

5. **Unclear Permission Requirements**
   - Be specific about required roles
   - Explain why permission is needed
   - Note if different operations need different permissions
   - Provide guidance for permission assignment

6. **Missing Error Cases**
   - Document ALL possible error codes
   - Explain conditions that trigger each error
   - Provide examples of error responses
   - Explain how to handle and prevent errors

```markdown
## Methods

| HTTP Method | Action | URI |
|---|---|---|
| GET | [List all employees](#list-employees) | `/employees` |
| GET | [Get employee by ID](#get-employee-by-id) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |
| POST | [Create employee](#create-employee) | `/employees` |
| PATCH | [Update employee](#update-employee) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |
| DELETE | [Delete employee](#delete-employee) | `/employees/{employeeId}` |
```

In Method documents (Level 2):
```markdown
## Update Employee

*See parent documentation*: [Employees REST API](#employees-rest-api)

*Related methods*:
- [Get Employee](#get-employee)
- [List Employees](#list-employees)
```

### OData Linking Strategy

In Service Overview (Level 1):
```markdown
## Resources

| Resource Name | Description | Path |
|---|---|---|
| [Employees](#employees-resource) | All employees | `/Employees` |
| [Departments](#departments-resource) | Departments | `/Departments` |
```

In Resource Document (Level 2):
```markdown
## Employees Resource

*Parent*: [Employees OData Service](#employees-odata-service)

### Operations

| Method | Operation | URI |
|---|---|---|
| GET | [Query all](#odata-operation-query-employees) | `/Employees` |
| POST | [Create](#odata-operation-create-employee) | `/Employees` |
```

In Operation Document (Level 3):
```markdown
## Create Employee (POST)

**Resource**: [Employees](#employees-resource)

**Service**: [Employees OData Service](#employees-odata-service)

**Related Operations**:
- [Query Employees](#operation-query-employees)
- [Get Employee](#operation-get-single-employee)
- [Update Employee](#operation-update-employee)
```

### Anchor Naming Conventions

**For Consistency and Reliability:**

- REST Overview: `#rest-api-[resource-name]`
  - Example: `#rest-api-employees`

- REST Methods: `#[verb]-[resource]` or `#[operation-name]`
  - Example: `#list-employees`, `#create-employee`, `#get-employee-by-id`

- OData Service: `#odata-service-[service-name]`
  - Example: `#odata-service-employees`

- OData Resource: `#odata-resource-[resource-name]`
  - Example: `#odata-resource-employees`

- OData Operation: `#odata-operation-[action]`
  - Example: `#odata-operation-create-employee`, `#odata-operation-query-employees`

### Cross-Document Linking

**When Documentation Spans Multiple Files:**

Use absolute paths:
```markdown
See \[Employees REST API](../rest-apis/employees.md#rest-api-employees)
for complete REST method documentation.
```

Or use markdown anchor syntax:
```markdown
See \[Employees REST API](rest-apis/employees.md) for complete REST documentation.
