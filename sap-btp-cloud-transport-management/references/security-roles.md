## Pre-Delivered Role Collections

| Collection | Included Role |
|------------|---------------|
| `TMS_LandscapeOperator_RC` | LandscapeOperator |
| `TMS_Viewer_RC` | Viewer |

## Node-Specific Restrictions

Three roles support restricting operations to specific transport nodes.

### Attributes

| Role | Attribute |
|------|-----------|
| TransportOperator | `TmsNodesTransportOperator` |
| ImportOperator | `TmsNodesImport` |
| ExportOperator | `TmsNodesExport` |

### Usage

1. Create role from template
2. Add attribute with node name(s)
3. Assign to role collection
4. User can only operate on specified nodes

**Example**: Restrict TransportOperator to only DEV and TEST nodes.

## Security Features

### Malware Scanning

**Policy**: TMS does not perform malware scans on uploaded archives.

**Rationale**: Archives treated as "black box" content without processing or extraction.

**Exception**: MTA deployment descriptors are verified for malware-free content.

**Responsibility**: Target applications must perform malware scanning during deployment.

---

### Encryption

**Transport**: SSL/TLS for all communications (HTTPS only)

**Storage**: Archives and MTA extension descriptors are **NOT encrypted** by persistency layer

**Mitigation**: Archives are only temporarily persisted and deleted after the configured file retention period (7-30 days depending on plan) has elapsed since the transport reached a final status (Deleted, Error, Skipped, Succeeded, Warning). See Storage Management in administration.md for retention details.

---

### Audit Logging

**Category**: `audit.security-events`

**Events Logged**:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Cleanup service runs | Scheduled file cleanup executed |
| Authorization check failed | API call without sufficient scope |
| Subscription plan updated | Plan changed successfully |
| Subscription plan update failed | Plan change failed |

---

### Data Protection

**Capabilities**:
- Export transport action logs
- Export MTA extension descriptors
- Export landscape configurations

**Use Cases**:
- Data protection compliance
- Decommissioning processes
- Backup procedures

---

## Backup Configuration

### PostgreSQL (Main Database)

**Contents**: Landscape configuration, transport requests, log files

**Backup**: Automatic, 14-day retention

**Restore**: Datacenter level only (not individual customers)

### Object Store

**Contents**: Uploaded files (MTAs), archived transport action logs

**Backup**: No automatic backup/restore

### Manual Export Options

1. Transport-related logs download
2. MTA extension descriptors download
3. Landscape configuration export

---

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

1. **Principle of least privilege**: Assign minimum required roles
2. **Separation of duties**:
   - Developers → ExportOperator
   - Operations → TransportOperator, ImportOperator
   - Admins → Administrator (sparingly)
3. **Node restrictions**: Use attributes to limit scope

### Technical Users

1. Use technical users for:
   - Destination authentication
   - CI/CD integrations
   - Automated operations

2. Benefits:
   - Avoid password rotation issues
   - No personal data considerations
   - Consistent authentication

### Security Monitoring

1. Review audit logs regularly
2. Monitor for authorization failures
3. Track subscription plan changes
