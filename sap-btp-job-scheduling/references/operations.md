## Service Behavior

### Execution Timing

#### Service Level Agreement

Scheduled jobs have approximately **20-minute tolerance** from their scheduled execution time.

#### Outage Recovery

| Outage Duration | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| < 20 minutes | All missed executions run immediately |
| >= 20 minutes | Only last missed execution runs |

**Rationale:** Prevents overwhelming target applications with excessive requests upon recovery.

### Schedule Auto-Deactivation

Schedules automatically deactivate when:

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| One-time executed | After successful or failed execution |
| No future dates | All possible execution times passed |
| endTime reached | Job or schedule end time in past |
| Endpoint unreachable | Action endpoint unreachable 10+ consecutive days |

### Request Handling

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| POST body limit | 100 KB |
| 413 response | Body size exceeded |
| Timezone | UTC only |
| Pagination default | 10 items |
| Pagination max | 200 items |

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Run logs | 15 days | Auto-deleted |
| Jobs/Schedules | Indefinite | Until deleted |
| Configurations | Indefinite | Until instance deleted |

---

## Backup and Restore

### Capabilities

The service supports restoration of accidentally deleted items:

| Restorable | Not Restorable |
|------------|----------------|
| Job configurations | Run logs |
| Task configurations | Same-day deletions |
| Schedule configurations | - |

### Restored Item State

| Property | Restored Value |
|----------|----------------|
| active | `false` (requires manual reactivation) |
| All other settings | Original values |

### Restoration Time Windows

| Region | Maximum Window |
|--------|----------------|
| AWS | 14 days |
| Azure | 14 days |
| GCP | 7 days |

### Same-Day Limitation

**Jobs and schedules created, modified, or deleted on the same day cannot be restored** due to daily backup dependency.

### Restoration Procedures

#### For Deleted Service Instances

Submit SAP support case with:
- Tenant ID of subaccount
- Deletion timestamp
- Old instance GUID (from Space Events audit logs)
- New empty instance GUID for recovery

#### For Deleted Subscriptions

Submit SAP support case with:
- Tenant ID
- Deletion timestamp
- Provider instance GUID

Then:
1. Create new subscription
2. Wait for restoration completion

### Getting Instance GUID

**Via CF CLI:**
```bash
cf service <instance-name> --guid
```

**Via Audit Logs:**
1. Access Cloud Foundry audit logs
2. Filter for Space Events
3. Find DELETE event for service instance
4. Extract instance GUID from event details

## Operational Best Practices

### Scheduling

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Avoid peak seconds | Don't use 0 or 30 |
| Avoid peak minutes | Don't use 0, 30, or multiples of 5 |
| Avoid top of hour | High demand periods |
| Avoid midnight UTC | Busiest time |
| Use irregular times | e.g., 01:12:17 vs 01:00:00 |

### Monitoring

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Dashboard | Manual review of run logs |
| Cloud ALM | Automated monitoring |
| Alert Notification | Event-driven alerts |
| REST API | Programmatic log retrieval |

### Maintenance

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Download critical logs | Before 15-day retention |
| Review failed jobs | Daily/Weekly |
| Credential rotation | Quarterly |
| Verify scope grants | After XSUAA changes |

### Capacity Planning

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Schedule count | Service plan based on schedules |
| Execution frequency | Rate limits apply |
| Run log volume | 15-day auto-deletion |
| Memory (CF tasks) | Default 1GB, configurable |
