3. Map groups to role collections
4. Users in mapped groups automatically receive roles

---

## Identity Provider Integration

### SAP Cloud Identity Services (Default)

```
Trust Configuration:
  Identity Provider: SAP Cloud Identity Services
  Domain: accounts.sap.com

User Format: <email>@<domain>
Example: john.doe@company.com
```

### Corporate Identity Provider (Custom IDP)

```
Trust Configuration:
  Identity Provider: Corporate SAML IDP
  Metadata: [Upload IDP metadata XML]

SAML Attribute: NameID (any supported format)
```

### SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)

```
Trust Configuration:
  Identity Provider: IAS Tenant
  Tenant URL: [https://<tenant>.accounts.ondemand.com](https://<tenant>.accounts.ondemand.com)

## Workflow User Assignment Template

When invoking workflows via Plan for Integration or Maintenance Planner:

### Initial Task Assignment

```

### Role-Based User Identification

During workflow execution, view role assignments:

1. Open task in My Inbox
2. Click role name in Task Instructions
3. View:
   - Role description
   - Complete list of assigned users

---

## Task Claiming Behavior

### Multi-User Task Assignment

When multiple users are assigned to a task:

1. Any assigned user can click **Claim** to lock the task
2. Task marked as **Reserved** for all other assigned users
3. Padlock icon appears next to claiming user in monitoring
4. Only claiming user can complete the task

### Best Practices

- Coordinate team assignments to avoid conflicts
- Use Integration Monitor role for stakeholders needing visibility
- Assign Integration Expert to implementation team members
- Reserve Integration Administrator for lead personnel
